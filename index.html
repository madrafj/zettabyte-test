          Even though lockdown for much of the UK began to ease in June, 
          the changing quarantine rules have meant that planning a summer holiday

          right now.

          As the world adjusts to the new normal, now we're looking ahead to the
          colder months and wondering which classic winter-sun destinations it's
          still possible to visit. Below we’ve collated the destinations that not
          only offer warm weather during December onwards, but are also open to 
          tourism and exempt from the English quarantine list (check the separate 
          government pages for Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland, as travel 
          restrictions in those countries are being tightened and loosened at 
          different times). Please note, we’ll aim to update this list regularly,
          but for the most up-to-date advice, visit the UK Foreign, Commonwealth 
          and Development Office.

      Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
      Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 
      1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to
      make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but 
      also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. 
      It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
      Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like
      Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
